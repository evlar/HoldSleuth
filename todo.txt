The next steps would be to:
1.  Create the frontend templates and static files for:
    - Wall scanning interface
    - Route creation/editing interface
    - Route listing and management

2. Add client-side JavaScript for:
    - Interactive hold placement
    - Route visualization
    - AJAX communication with the backend
    - Would you like me to proceed with creating the frontend components?
