The next steps would be to:
1.  Create the frontend templates and static files for:
    - Wall scanning interface
    - Route creation/editing interface
    - Route listing and management

2. Add client-side JavaScript for:
    - Interactive hold placement
    - Route visualization
    - AJAX communication with the backend
    - Would you like me to proceed with creating the frontend components?


To complete the integration, you'll need to:
Connect the physical sensors (inclinometer, distance sensor) to update wall_position and wall_angle
Implement the actual projection output (likely using a graphics library to render to the projector)
Add calibration functionality to align the projector with the wall
Would you like me to help with any of these next steps?
